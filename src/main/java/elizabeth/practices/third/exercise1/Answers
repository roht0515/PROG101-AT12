R.- The only methods that the collection could invoke would be the base class methods.

● If Castle class has implemented void castle() method, could it be possible
to invoke that method from a reference to the base class? Why?
R.- No, because this method is only of derived class.

● What should we have to do in order to be able to use the previous void castle()
method from an object of Castle class that is pointed by a reference to Figure class?
R.- Casting the "Figure" object  to "Castle" would then use the castle() method.

 reference to the base class?
 R.- Asking if an object is an instance of a specific class Using the keyword "instanceOf"
